☀️ Tiny tools for MCPs.

The [studio] is a connector, the smallest possible [MCP].

Each wall hums with quiet current, wires tucked like thoughts behind plaster, ready to *spark light*, *boil water*, *light a book*, *play a love song*. Flip a switch, and the room answers: radiant heat through old pipes like warmth returning to cold fingers, a soft bulb blooming over your book like a campfire lit in the hush of night.

Plumbing threads beneath your feet like an underground river, clean water in, waste water out, the pulse of modern life made invisible but intimate. Every faucet turn a small ceremony, a kettle filled to make tea, a rinse of your face to reset the day, dishes washed clouds the windows like breath and nose smudged against glass.

The studio draws the vast circuits: power plants, reservoirs, cell towers, and condenses them into loft and hearth. The glow of neon cast across the ceiling, split in panes, a lighthouse calling in the world from fog. The radiator’s purr, the heartbeat of your borough. Everything here is alive, connected, and negotiating space just like you.

Your body, too, is wired neural pathways, electrical signals, a pulse. The studio is a smaller self: a nervous system of systems.

In this way, the studio becomes not just shelter, but socket, where the immensity of life plugs in and powers through your particular, incandescent corner.

Possibilities in the smallest places.
